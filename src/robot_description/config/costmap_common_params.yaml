# Obstacle range: determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap
obstacle_range: 0.35


#The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace
#given a sensor reading. Setting it to x meters as we have above means that the robot will
#attempt to clear out space in front of it up to x meters away given a sensor reading.

# The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from obstacles at which a
#cost should be incurred. For example, setting the inflation radius at x meters means
#that the robot will treat all paths that stay x meters or more away from obstacles as
#having equal obstacle cost.
