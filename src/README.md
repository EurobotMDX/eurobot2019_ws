# Eurobot 2019

Repository exclusively for team Brainstorm - Middlesex University

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```
* [Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi - web](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/) - Download Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry Pi
* [Ubuntu install of ROS Kinetic - web](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) - Installation process in steps

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the ROS

Explanation how to run the ROS

## Project Documentation

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Useful Documents

* [Markdown Cheatsheet - github](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [ROS Cheat Sheet - pdf](http://www.tedusar.eu/files/summerschool2013/ROScheatsheet.pdf)
* [MD25 Motor Controller I2C for Arduino -web](https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/arduino_examples.htm#MD25%20RD02%20Motor%20Controller) - Pinout scheme and arduino .ino example

## Small Robot

* [Driving for MD25 - github](https://github.com/DiefBell/MD25) - An object-oriented Arduino library for controlling the MD25 motor controller (via I2C).

```
In order to install this library, find your Arduino folder, 
then place the MD25 folder (NOT the "MD25-master" folder) into your libraries folder. 
Folder structure should look something like:
/Arduino/libraries/MD25/src/ /examples/ keywords.txt etc...
```
